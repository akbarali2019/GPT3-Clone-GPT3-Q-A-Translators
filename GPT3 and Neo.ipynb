      "Historical Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashkent was founded by the ancient Huns in the 6th century A.D. as a fortress town on the southern bank of the Amu Darya River. It was a major imperial city during the Kushan and Lakhmid eras. After the fall of the Khmelinskiy Khaghanate, it became a capital of the Samanid Empire. In 988, the Samanid ruler Ghazan was killed by the Khwarezmid dynasty in the battle of Qarshi, when the Uighur troops were attacked by the Tajiks. The capital now changed to Tashkent. As the capital of Turkomans and Tajiks, it was an important center in the history of Central Asia after the Mongol invasion. As a result, the city was the first to be conquered by the Mongols. The city was a center of the Great Game for centuries. The first Uzbek army of the Uyghurs came to Tashkent in 1218 during the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazm Khanate. In the meantime, the Mongols had captured Kalka and many other cities, and were expanding their empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city of Tashkent, which was one of the earliest major urban centers of the Uighur Empire, was renamed Batken city (Batken is Turkmen: Batkent), which was a small fortress town on the southern bank of the Amu Darya River. Its population was primarily Muslim. The first known Muslim leader of the Uighurs, Haji Muhammad Salih Khan Bukhrui (b. 1601), came from Batken city. His son Musa Sultan (b. 1651) was the first Uighur to rule Uzbekistan. Tashkent and the rest of Uzbekistan became a large center for Uighur civilization, which at its peak employed some 40,000 people, the highest Uighur population in the world. The Tami tribe and Uyghurs formed a majority of the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uzbekistan was renamed from Tashkent to Tashkent khanate after the death of the last khan, Babur in 1578 A.D. During the rule of Babur, the city was established in 1578 as a khanate. Upon the death of Babur, the city once again became a capital city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first four to five Tajiks (the Tajiks are Turkic-speaking indigenous peoples of Central Asia) who came to Tashkent were converted to Islam, as were the majority of the nomads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashkent was named the capital of Turkistan by the Uyghur emir, Ahmad Shah Beg (1469–1523), who ruled Uzbekistan for 20 years from 1492 to 1504. The old name Batken city was changed to Tashkent khanate or Tashkent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1619, the Uyghur emir, Ahmed Izzuddin Khan, arrived in the city, and it became the capital of the Turkistan Khanate. In 1621, the city was renamed as Tashkent khanate. Tashkent was the capital of the Turkestan, a region in Central Asia that had the Uyghur as the majority. Tashkent khanate became a major center of the Samanid Empire in the 12th century under the rule of the Samanids. The modern city was founded in 1720 by Qara Saqiram Beg.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Uighurs, under Hami Khan, rebelled in Samarkand (1456–60), but were crushed by the army of Timur (Tamerlane) in 1481. The Uighurs continued to resist and were again suppressed in 1370, until they were defeated by Timur in 1388. Under Timur, the Uighur armies defeated the Samanids. The two rivals ended up at the peace treaty with Timur in 1481.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rashin Khan, the first Uzbek khan, was the first Uzbek leader to be converted to Islam. This was in 1488, during the reign of Shah Rukh Khan (1469–1504). When it became a capital city, he moved his capital to Tashkent.\n",
